Day 57: Templating with Jinja in Flask Applications

And in order to do that, we're going to be learning about URL building and templating with Jinja. So very often when you're creating a website, you'll get cases where you actually don't want to create the page entirely from scratch. For example,
if you had a blog and you wanted to have several different posts in the blog, you don't want to create a separate HTML file for each blog post.
